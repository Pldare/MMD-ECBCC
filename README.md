# mikumikudance-Eyeball control bone coordinate calculation
I am a c programming beginner.This is the first project I wrote.
This project is used to calculate the coordinates of the eyeball control bone in the MMD model.
When in use, select indirect three vertices in the pmx editor. As long as you think the eyeball may spin to these three points.
Copy the coordinates directly in pmxeditor and paste them into the command line.

直接在PMX editor中复制三个你眼球可能会旋转到的顶点，将坐标复制到命令行即可。
